IMPLEMENT:

- keep a list of message / email address in order to avoid resending to the same email (unless force is checked)
- send a copy to ...
- demo mode should be a switch in config.py

MORE IDEAS:

- have recipient lists which are SQL queries.
>> recipients creation should be part of another panel (more advanced one).
>> templates are connected to recipients (variables being used) so it might not be a good idea to disociate the two.

- have an export data as CSV option.
- need to be able to save templates.
- need to keep rack of exactly which email was sent and to whom.
